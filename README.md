# Chrome and Firefox diffrences
Only diffrence between these two is `manifest_version` - for Firefox it's `2` and Chrome use `3`

# Known issues
1. It doesn't skip all ads, and leaves about 5 sec of ads (which is still much better then 3min)
2. Sometimes it shows 1 sec of actual content when ads are played, but, after end of process(skiping ads) video is loaded as it should, and where it ended before ads.
